# Divya_Drishti - Eyes for Everyone
Shiv Singh | IIT Kharagpur | Self Project

Divya Drishti is an android app designed and structured so as to aid the visually impaired section of the world to gain independence in performing their daily chores,
making their lives slightly better. The app not only caters to the needs of the total population of 49.1 million blind persons but also has some very useful features 
which can make lives of many other people easier like the OCR Reader which gives voice output that can help read text without having to actually look at it.
The app is implemented for android devices and Java language is used throughout. It uses google text-speech services for voice inputs and outputs apart from existence
of buttons.
## Currently Divya Drishti has the following functional features:-
### 1. Facial Expression Recognition
   Also known as the emotion recognition, it detects the emotion represented by the human face with significant accuracy as of now. It displays the probabilities 
   of different possible emotions in the chosen face and returns the voice output of the most likely one. It can detect emotions like happiness, anger, sadness etc.
   The user can either pick an existing image or click an image immediately to detect facial expression.
   
### 2. OCR Reader
   It scans through realtime camera and after the user taps on the screen, starts reading the text for the user to listen and understand. For blind users it can be used 
   extensively to read all the documents, enjoy novels, read banners or shop names. Similarly the other users can also make use of it to listen to the contents of the 
   texts. It is preety fast and accurate at reading printed texts.
   
### 3. Object Detection
   The feature can detect and recognise objects among more than 70 classes. In future more classes will be included and the accuracy will be further increases so that
   the users can rely on this more in future.
  
### 4. Face Recognition
   The feature has very premium functionality to add the faces of the people to the recognition list whoever one wants. The voice output is returned to tell the name of the person. Due to the lack of time, the database wasn't integrated to it so the recongnition list becomes empty once the app closes but it will definitely be added
   later. For now the user can add people's faces to recognition list and identify them till the app is not closed.
   
### 5. Voice Calculator
   Operates and gives result in voice, it performs calculations fairly fast which is useful for all the users.    
  
### 6. Location
   It can output the current location of the user (in voice) so that the blind users can never get lost and can know their locality immediately.
   
### 7. Weather
   It speaks the weather of any city chosen by the user accurately.
   
### 8.Time and Date
   It speaks the current time and date, again a simple yet powerful feature to make the blind users independent. (Also for unaware people like me who never know 
   the date :)

### 9.Battery
   Speaks the current battery status and advises to charge the phone if it is below 50%.
   
### 10.Currency Detection:
   For now it can detect among 3 currency denominations i.e 100 rs, 10 Rs, 500 Rs. Well I wouldn't say it is accurate as of now but in near future will it be able 
   to recognise all currency notes that to accurately.
   
  ## Future Plans
   
1. Bank Transfer
   It is NOT functional just a prototype yet. This is especially designed for the visually impaired to do bank payments through voice inputs altogether. It mainly 
   requires IFSC code, Account number and the amount value to processthe transaction. Similarly can it be used by other users proving it to be a very useful feature.
   The app also confirms the details entered by the user by repeating it through voice. This will be functional in future.
   
2. Phone Transfer
   It is NOT functional just a prototype. It was designed for the similar motive as bank transfer and requires name of the person, account number, and the ammount to
   be transferred. This will be made functional in future.
   
3. Image Captioning
   This will give a human understandable description of the image captured by the user to make her feel included and make her able to "see" the world.
   This will require complex pipeline of ML model and will be similar to Show, Attend and Tell neural network.
   
4. Addition of Database to face recognition will be done and accuracy of current ML models will be increaesed.

## STEPS TO SET UP THE PROJECT
 1. Just clone the repository in android studio
 2. The android studio will take few minutes to build the project.
 3. Connect your android device via USB Debugging and run. **DON'T USE EMULATOR TO TEST THE PROJECT--> USE ANDROID DEVICE ONLY**
 4. Yey! Feel free to explore the app ;)
